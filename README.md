# Verse

A basic **Kotlin** application which scraps google to fetch lyrics using jsoup. 
Uses ACR Cloud to identify the song played.


 
## Used concepts

1) Broadcast receiver to fetch details about the song played in spotify.
2) Jsoup to download the google search page for the played song.
3) Kotlin to manipulate the received data from google. 
4) ACRCloud's song recognition. 

## UI

A clean UI to help the user use the application without any prior knowledge on the subject. 

## Features

1) Since the lyrics are scrapped from google, the lyrics for most of the songs are shown in the application.
2) Works on multiple languages.
3) Ability to open spotify from within the app.
4) Song recognition. 


## TODO
1) Buy a musixmatch developer account and use its richsync and lyric sync features to sync the lyrics to the song played on spotify.
2) Add more domains to search for the lyrics rather than just google.
3) Ability to read notifications by spotify to detect advertisement and mute the device till the ad is over. (This feature has already been implemented but the problem is to get user permission to gain notification access for the app and work forever. If you are interested/ have a solution to this problem, post your answer in                                   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62158583/notificationlistenerservice-requires-to-toggle-notification-access-on-every-laun) )
